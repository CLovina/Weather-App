I created a local weather web application, using API to get my local weather conditions. 

 #### Implemented 
 Weather API https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx for local temperature and weather conditions. 
 
 This site caused problems for me later on when trying to get icons (couldn't get them to change). 
 
 #### Built With 
 JavaScript, HTML and CSS 
 
 #### Acknowledgements
