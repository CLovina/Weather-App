 I created this local weather web application following Dev Ed's Youtube tutorial:

 #### Implemented 
 Weather API https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx for local temperature and weather conditions. 
 
 I would not recommend using this for this project as it caused problems later when trying to get icons (couldn't get them to change). 
 
 #### Built With 
 JavaScript, HTML and CSS 
 
 #### Acknowledgements
